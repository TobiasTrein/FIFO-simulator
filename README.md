To run this script, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. The script has been developed and tested on Python 3.

Run the following command to download all the dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the script providing a config.yml file with the same options as above, one option per line, as the example:

```yml
ch:
  # name
  - "ch"
  # arrival
  - [2, 3]
  # running
  - [2, 5]
  # capacity
  - 3
  # workers
  - 2
p:
  # name
  - "p"
  # arrival
  - [2, 5]
  # running
  - [3, 5]
  # capacity
  - 3
  # workers
  - 1
start_time: 2.5
iterations: 100000
reps: 5
```

If the config.yml file is not present, the script will use default values.
